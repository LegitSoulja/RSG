# RSG (Rust Skin Generator)
This was a **web** project I made in the past for personal use and decided to turn this into an electron app for public use.

I do not plan to future maintain or even make this project better as it's intended to do what I wanted and no more.

I will however kindly accept any PR/contributions there may be.
